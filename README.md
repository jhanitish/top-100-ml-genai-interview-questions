    Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units like words, subwords, or characters for processing by language models. For example, the sentence "Machine Learning is fun!" could be tokenized as ["Machine", "Learning", "is", "fun", "!"]. Tokenization helps models understand and generate text efficiently.

38. **Explain the importance of pre-training and transfer learning.**  
    - **Pre-Training:** Models are trained on large datasets to learn general features.

**90. What is model drift, and how can it be mitigated?**  
Model drift occurs when the data distribution changes over time, causing model performance to degrade.  
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Periodic retraining.  
  - Monitoring data and predictions.  
  - Employing online learning methods.


**91. How would you design an A/B test for an ML system?**  
1. Identify a metric (e.g., click-through rate).  
2. Divide users into control and test groups randomly.  
3. Deploy the baseline model for control and the new model for the test group.  
4. Measure and compare the impact on the chosen metric using statistical significance tests.


**92. What is the difference between online and offline inference?**  
- **Online Inference:** Real-time predictions (e.g., chatbots, recommendation systems).  
- **Offline Inference:** Batch predictions processed periodically (e.g., generating daily reports).

**93. How do you choose the right evaluation metric for a problem?**  
- **Classification:** Precision, recall, F1-score for imbalanced classes; accuracy for balanced classes.  
- **Regression:** RMSE, MAE, or R-squared based on tolerance for error.  
- **Generative Models:** Inception Score (IS), FrÃ©chet Inception Distance (FID) for image generation.

**94. Explain the importance of explainability in Generative AI models.**  
Explainability helps stakeholders understand the reasoning behind model outputs, builds trust, and identifies potential biases or flaws. Techniques include SHAP, LIME, and attention visualization.

**95. How do you balance performance and fairness in ML models?**  
- Use fairness-aware algorithms (e.g., adversarial debiasing).  
- Regularly evaluate fairness metrics like demographic parity.  
- Involve diverse perspectives during development to identify potential biases.

**96. What is differential privacy, and how is it applied in AI systems?**  
Differential privacy ensures that individual data points cannot be inferred from aggregated outputs.  
- **Application:** Adding noise to data or results to protect user privacy in analytics and AI training.

**97. How do you handle adversarial attacks on models?**  
- **Detection:** Monitor for unusual patterns in inputs or outputs.  
- **Prevention:** Use adversarial training to make the model robust to perturbations.  
- **Defense:** Apply techniques like input sanitization and ensemble models.

**98. What is federated learning, and how does it work?**  
Federated learning trains models across decentralized devices without centralizing data.  
- **How It Works:** Devices compute model updates locally and share only these updates with a central server, preserving privacy.


**99. Explain the concept of a knowledge graph and its applications in AI.**  
A knowledge graph is a structured representation of entities and their relationships.  
- **Applications:** Semantic search, recommendation systems, and question-answering systems.

**100. How do you ensure reproducibility in ML experiments?**  
- Use version control for code and data (e.g., Git, DVC).  
- Log experimental configurations and results with tools like MLflow or Weights & Biases.  
- Ensure deterministic results with fixed random seeds and controlled environments.  



101. **What is GPT, and how does it work?**
    GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a type of LLM that generates human-like text. It is trained using unsupervised learning on a large corpus of text data and fine-tuned for specific tasks using supervised learning.

102. **Explain the role of the encoder and decoder in Transformers.**
    - **Encoder:** Processes input data and generates a representation.
    - **Decoder:** Uses the encoded representation to generate output (e.g., text, translations).

103. **What is BERT, and how does it differ from GPT?**
    BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is designed for understanding text (e.g., classification), while GPT focuses on generating text.

104. **What are self-supervised learning techniques, and how do they apply to Generative AI?**  
    Self-supervised learning is a subset of unsupervised learning where the system predicts parts of data from other parts. It is commonly used in Generative AI to train models like GPT by creating tasks such as next-word prediction or image completion.

105. **What is a latent space in Generative AI models?**  
    A latent space is a lower-dimensional representation of data, often used in models like VAEs and GANs. In Generative AI, latent spaces enable interpolation and manipulation of data to generate new samples.

106. **Explain the concept of diffusion models in generative AI.**  
    Diffusion models are probabilistic methods that generate data by reversing a noise-injection process. They iteratively refine data from random noise to produce coherent results, as seen in text-to-image generation tasks.

107. **What are zero-shot and few-shot learning in large language models?**  
    - **Zero-shot learning:** The model performs a task without specific task examples during training (e.g., summarizing unseen topics).  
    - **Few-shot learning:** The model learns from a few examples provided during task prompts.

108. **What is the significance of pretraining and fine-tuning in LLMs?**  
    - **Pretraining:** Trains a model on large, general datasets for broad understanding.  
    - **Fine-tuning:** Adjusts the pretrained model on domain-specific data to improve performance on specific tasks.

109. **How do attention heads work in Transformers?**  
    Attention heads capture relationships between words or tokens in a sequence by assigning weights based on relevance. Multiple heads allow the model to focus on different aspects of the data simultaneously.

110. **What are the limitations of Generative AI models like GPT and GANs?**  
    - Lack of interpretability.  
    - Prone to generating biased or incorrect content.  
    - High computational and data resource requirements.  
    - Challenges in controlling output specificity.
